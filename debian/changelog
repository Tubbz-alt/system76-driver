system76-driver (14.10.8~alpha) utopic; urgency=low

  * Daily WIP for 14.10.8
  * system76driver.read_dmi_id() is now failsafe when "sys_vendor" or
    "product_version" contain invalid UTF-8 data; this would never be the case
    on an actual System76 product, but the driver should politely do nothing
    when installed on non-System76 hardware
  * Add "meer1" (Meerkat) to PRODUCTS
  * Add "lemu5" (Lemur) to PRODUCTS, NEEDS_BRIGHTNESS

system76-driver (14.10.6) utopic; urgency=low

  * Re-enable wifi_pm_disable for all haswell gen products, seemingly still
    needed with some access points, even with the 3.16 kernel
  * Small cosmetic changes so that the difference between the LTS and trunk
    driver branches is small and manageable
  * Add debian/system76-driver.service file for initial systemd support
    (LP: #1390152)

system76-driver (14.10.5) utopic; urgency=low

  * Also add `internal_mic_gain` action back for daru4, gazp9b, and kudp1b,
    likewise still needed on Utopic
  * system76driver/daemon.py: add a number of small optimizations that in total
    mean that support for the airplane mode hotkey (Haswell gen laptops) incurs
    around half the events per second and less than a quarter of the CPU usage
    (as measured by `powertop`)
  * Drop `wifi_pm_disable` action from all Haswell gen laptops as the latest
    3.16 kernel plus the latest linux-firmware package seem to have completely
    fixed the latency, reliability, and performance issues previously
    encountered when power management was turned on for Intel 3160/7260 cards

system76-driver (14.10.3) utopic; urgency=low

  * Update to new System76 branding!
  * debian/system76-driver.install: don't install "Old Man Smoked His Pipe"
    wallpaper, nor system76-wallpapers.xml, as these files have moved into the
    new `system76-wallpapers` package (separate source package/tree)
  * debian/control: `system76-driver` now depends on "system76-wallpapers"
  * debian/system76-driver.gsettings-override: switch default background to
    "Geometric" for new System76 brand launch
  * debian/system76-driver.gsettings-override: add [com.canonical.Unity.Lenses]
    section, set 'remote-content-search' to 'none'

system76-driver (14.10.0) utopic; urgency=low

    laptop products with the Linux 3.16 kernel (LP: #1356507)
  * Switch from `acpi_video0` to `intel_backlight` on all Haswell products,
    use 75% of max_brightness for default brightness (LP: #1375477)

    restore, "start on (login-session-start or desktop-session-start)"

  * Drop `internal_mic_gain` action from daru4, galu1, gazp9b, and kudp1b, as

system76-driver (14.04.7) trusty; urgency=low

system76-driver (14.04.6) trusty; urgency=low

  * As screen revisions within a product lifetime make it too difficult to
    supply a correct color profile out of the box, drop color profile actions
    from bonx7, galu1, gazp9 (note this wont remove profiles already
    installed, will only effect new shipments and re-installs)
  * debian/control: drop Build-Depends/Depends on `python3-dbus`, as it was
    only needed for color-profile actions
  * debian/control: add Depends on `pm-utils` as some driver actions expect
    /etc/pm/power.d/ to exist, which seems not to be installed by default on
    Xubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME
  * Rework GrubAction and its subclasses so that it preserves customer changes
    and can also remove previously added kernel parameters when needed
  * Rework system76-driver-cli to make it more suitable for automatically
    being called from a postinst script
  * Add debian/system76-driver.postinst that automatically calls
    /usr/bin/system76-driver-cli
  * system76-daemon no longer needs to fix caps on /bin/ping, /bin/ping6,
    /usr/bin/arping as the `iputils` package as been updated and reverted to
    use suid again; however, caps fix on /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon is
    still needed
  * Add remove_backlight_vendor action to gazp9, gazp9b to properly remove
    acpi_backlight=vendor from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
  * On daru4, replace `grub_daru4` with `backlight_vendor` plus
    `disable_power_well` actions now that GrubAction is cumulative

system76-driver (14.04.5) trusty; urgency=low

  * Add hdmi_hotplug_fix action to daru4, galu1, gazp9, gazp9b, kudp1, kudp1b

  * Add disable_power_well action to galu1, gazp9, gazp9b, kudp1, kudp1b
  * Add grub_daru4 action to daru4, which combines the `backlight_vendor` and
    `disable_power_well` actions
  * Up Airplane Mode poll interval to 500ms (from 375ms)
  * system76-daemon will now automatically fix caps on /bin/ping, /bin/ping6,
    /usr/bin/arping, and /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon to correct for imaging
    not correctly handling caps for a short time after Trusty was released
