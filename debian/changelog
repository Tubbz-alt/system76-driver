system76-driver (14.04.8) trusty; urgency=low

    * Re-enable backlight_vendor action on gazp9 as some early BIOS versions

system76-driver (14.04.7) trusty; urgency=low

system76-driver (14.04.6) trusty; urgency=low

    * As screen revisions within a product lifetime make it too difficult to
      supply a correct color profile out of the box, drop color profile actions
      from bonx7, galu1, gazp9 (note this wont remove profiles already
      installed, will only effect new shipments and re-installs)
    * debian/control: drop Build-Depends/Depends on `python3-dbus`, as it was
      only needed for color-profile actions
    * debian/control: add Depends on `pm-utils` as some driver actions expect
      /etc/pm/power.d/ to exist, which seems not to be installed by default on
      Xubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME
    * Rework GrubAction and its subclasses so that it preserves customer changes
      and can also remove previously added kernel parameters when needed
    * Rework system76-driver-cli to make it more suitable for automatically
      being called from a postinst script
    * Add debian/system76-driver.postinst that automatically calls
      /usr/bin/system76-driver-cli
    * system76-daemon no longer needs to fix caps on /bin/ping, /bin/ping6,
      /usr/bin/arping as the `iputils` package as been updated and reverted to
      use suid again; however, caps fix on /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon is
      still needed
    * Add remove_backlight_vendor action to gazp9, gazp9b to properly remove
      acpi_backlight=vendor from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
    * On daru4, replace `grub_daru4` with `backlight_vendor` plus
      `disable_power_well` actions now that GrubAction is cumulative

system76-driver (14.04.5) trusty; urgency=low

    * Add disable_power_well action to galu1, gazp9, gazp9b, kudp1, kudp1b
    * Add grub_daru4 action to daru4, which combines the `backlight_vendor` and
      `disable_power_well` actions
    * Up Airplane Mode poll interval to 500ms (from 375ms)
    * system76-daemon will now automatically fix caps on /bin/ping, /bin/ping6,
      /usr/bin/arping, and /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon to correct for imaging
      not correctly handling caps for a short time after Trusty was released
