What the hell is YanC?
======================
YanC42 or formerly known as "Yet another nV Configurator" is a small tool, which you can use to change many nVidia and ATI-specific settings (almost) as easily as with the Windows-drivers. 

Why YanC42?
===========
Well, you might consider it as the 42nd attempt to rewrite the old YanC codebase. Some might even link it to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and consider it as the answer to the ultimate question...
To be honest, just consider it as a YanC for two (nVidia and ATI) ;-)

Thanks to:
==========
YanC uses 
- the Java programming language. See http://java.sun.com for details.
- the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), which has been created by the Eclipse Foundation (http://www.eclipse.org). Please see about.html for license details.
- a modified startup script from the Azureus project, see http://azureus.sf.net for details

Requirements:
=============
ix86-based Linux
nVidia or ATI graphics card with correctly installed binary driver
XFree 4 or better
Java Runtime Environment, at least 1.4.2, 5.0 is recommended

WARNING:
========
-> Please create a copy of your XF86Config/xorg.conf before you use YanC42 for the first time, because it is possible that your XF86Config/xorg.conf will get damaged because of the use of YanC42. Then a restart of XFree/XOrg would be impossible.

Installation
============
-> Extract the archive (Guess you did this already to access this README ;-))
-> Run the 'yanc' script as root to start the program

Documentation
=============
-> A documentation is planned for a later release
